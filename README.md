### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Marc Geremias Serra, from Blanes (Spain) and currently doing my third year Computer Engineering at [La Salle Campus Barcelona](https://www.salleurl.edu). As a tech enthusiast, I am always eager to learn about new and exciting developments in the field. I have a love for exploring and discovering new things, and I enjoy being self-taught.
